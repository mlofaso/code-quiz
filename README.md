Module 4 Challenge

## Description

Created a JavaScript quiz using HTML, basic CSS, and JavaScript.  Added functionality to start button, question answers, as well as ability to submit a single score.  Also added a timer that decrements when questions are answered incorrectly, as well as going down to zero when all questions have been answered.
